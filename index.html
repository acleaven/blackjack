<!-- Blackjack homework assignment.
Team members:
Chris Bonk
Andy Cleavenger
John Morabito

Division of tasks:
Chris and John wrote most of the framework for the HTML. Chris created the player and dealer areas
for the cards, and John created the button panel and cash/bet amount areas. The page contents were
altered a bit by Andy as he was working on the CSS, mostly to add or change the locations of IDs/classes.

            <p>Each face card is worth 10. Each ace is worth 1 or 11. Our game is programmed to make them worth 11 by
                default unless it would cause the player to bust, then it is automatically changed to 1. Every other
                card is worth its pip value.</p>
            <p>The player and the dealer are both initially dealt two cards. The first dealer card stays face down until
                the player stands or busts. The player is allowed to adjust the bet only until the first deal is completed.
                The player may then request an additional card with the hit button until they exceed 21.</p>
            <p>Our dealer stands at 17.</p></div>
